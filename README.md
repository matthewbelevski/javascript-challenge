# javascript-challenge

For the Javascript challenge, the goal was to display data into a table on a webpage which was then filterable based on an input field or multiple input fields. This filtered data was then displayed onto the webpage in place of the original data.

The challenge was split into two. UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2. 

UFO-level-1 was a simple filter based on one input form which was the date.

UFO-level-2 required a more complex filter which had 5 separate input forms which included the date, city, state, country, and shape. This data was then to be filtered based on either 1 form being filled out, a combination of the forms, or all the forms at once.
